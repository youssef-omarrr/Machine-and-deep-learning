    "Whole books could be written on the different types of machine learning model deployment (and many good ones are listed in [PyTorch Extra Resources](https://www.learnpytorch.io/pytorch_extra_resources/#resources-for-machine-learning-and-deep-learning-engineering)).\n",

    "> \"What is the most ideal scenario for my machine learning model to be used?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "And then work backwards from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you may not know this ahead of time. But you're smart enough to imagine such things.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of FoodVision Mini, our ideal scenario might be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Someone takes a photo on a mobile device (through an app or web broswer).\n",
    "- The prediction comes back fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we've got two main criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The model should work on a mobile device (this means there will be some compute constraints).\n",
    "2. The model should make predictions _fast_ (because a slow app is a boring app).\n",
    "\n",
    "And of course, depending on your use case, your requirements may vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may notice the above two points break down into another two questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Where's it going to go?** - As in, where is it going to be stored?\n",
    "2. **How's it going to function?** - As in, does it return predictions immediately? Or do they come later?\n",

    "\n",
    "To check our model's size in bytes, we can use Python's [`pathlib.Path.stat(\"path_to_model\").st_size`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.stat) and then we can convert it (roughly) to megabytes by dividing it by `(1024*1024)`.\n"

    "We've now got a `model.py` script as well as a path to a saved model `state_dict` that we can load in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time to construct `app.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call it `app.py` because by default when you create a HuggingFace Space, it looks for a file called `app.py` to run and host (though you can change this in settings).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our `app.py` script will put together all of the pieces of the puzzle to create our Gradio demo and will have four main parts: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Imports and class names setup** - Here we'll import the various dependencies for our demo including the `create_effnetb2_model()` function from `model.py` as well as setup the different class names for our FoodVision Mini app. \n",
    "2. **Model and transforms preparation** - Here we'll create an EffNetB2 model instance along with the transforms to go with it and then we'll load in the saved model weights/`state_dict`. When we load the model we'll also set `map_location=torch.device(\"cpu\")` in [`torch.load()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.load.html) so our model gets loaded onto the CPU regardless of the device it trained on (we do this because we won't necessarily have a GPU when we deploy and we'll get an error if our model is trained on GPU but we try to deploy it to CPU without explicitly saying so).\n",
    "3. **Predict function** - Gradio's `gradio.Interface()` takes a `fn` parameter to map inputs to outputs, our `predict()` function will be the same as the one we defined above in [section 7.2: *Creating a function to map our inputs and outputs*](https://www.learnpytorch.io/09_pytorch_model_deployment/#72-creating-a-function-to-map-our-inputs-and-outputs), it will take in an image and then use the loaded transforms to preprocess it before using the loaded model to make a prediction on it.\n",
    "    * **Note:** We'll have to create the example list on the fly via the `examples` parameter. We can do so by creating a list of the files inside the `examples/` directory with: `[[\"examples/\" + example] for example in os.listdir(\"examples\")]`.\n",
    "4. **Gradio app** - This is where the main logic of our demo will live, we'll create a `gradio.Interface()` instance called `demo` to put together our inputs, `predict()` function and outputs. And we'll finish the script by calling `demo.launch()` to launch our FoodVision Mini demo!"
