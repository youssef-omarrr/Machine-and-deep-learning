## Summary

This lecture mainly talks about the **ethical side** of AI and deep learning, here are the most important notes:
- **Biasing** in the models are a problem that sill has no definitive solution.
- LLM **hallucination** is a dumb way to describe it, because it implies that it's **sometimes** inaccurate, when in reality it's always hallucinating, it only generate things **YOU** want to see, may not be always accurate or even true.
- *You* can have a **Hippocratic oath** but *your AI* can't (your AI, your responsibility).
