The `**` before `input_ids` in this line:

```python
outputs = model.generate(**input_ids, do_sample=True, max_new_tokens=max_new_tokens, temperature=temperature)
```

is Python syntax for **argument unpacking** of a dictionary into keyword arguments.

### üîç What's going on?

When you tokenize like this:

```python
input_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors='pt').to(model.device)
```

the result is a dictionary like:

```python
{
    'input_ids': tensor([...]),
    'attention_mask': tensor([...])
}
```

By using `**input_ids`, you're unpacking this dictionary into the function call like:

```python
model.generate(input_ids=tensor([...]), attention_mask=tensor([...]), ...)
```

So this is **shorthand** for explicitly passing each argument in the dictionary.

### ‚úÖ Why it's used

Because `transformers` models like `GPT2`, `T5`, or `LLaMA` often require both `input_ids` and `attention_mask` (and sometimes more), unpacking the whole dictionary is cleaner and less error-prone than writing them out manually.

Let me know if you want to see this in a minimal working example.
