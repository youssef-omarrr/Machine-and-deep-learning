## Key Components

### 1. CNN Classifier for Faces

* Implements a standard CNN to predict whether an image contains a face.

### 2. VAE to Model Latent Structure

* Compresses images into a latent space capturing features such as skin tone, pose, and background.
* Learns latent distributions via encoder (`mu`, `log-sigma`) and decoder, enabling reconstruction.

### 3. Debiasing Loss Function

* Combines three components:

  * **Reconstruction loss**: Measures pixel-wise difference between original and decoded image.
  * **Classification loss**: Using sigmoid cross-entropy for face detection.
  * **KL divergence loss**: Regularizes latent variables toward a Gaussian prior.
* Incorporates a **gradient mask**: backpropagates VAE gradients only for face-positive samples, focusing debiasing on relevant cases ([abhijitramesh.me][1], [arxiv.org][3], [arxiv.org][4], [blog.tensorflow.org][2]).

## Workflow

1. Load and preprocess a dataset with demographic labels.
2. Build and train the combined CNN+VAE architecture.
3. Visualize latent reconstructions and classification outputs.
4. Evaluate bias reduction, showing improved fairness while retaining overall detection accuracy.

## Purpose & Impact

The notebook demonstrates how **learned latent structure (via VAE)** can be used not only for reconstruction but also to **counteract bias** in classifiers by minimizing hidden correlations tied to sensitive attributes ([arxiv.org][5]). This framework aligns with the paper *“Uncovering and Mitigating Algorithmic Bias through Learned Latent Structure.”*

### What Db-VAE is Designed For:

Db-VAE is tailored to address **bias** in datasets — for example:

* Unequal representation of skin tones in face detection
* Gender or race imbalance in image data

It works by learning a **latent representation** that:

* **Reconstructs images well**
* **Classifies relevant features**
* **Is less correlated with biased or spurious features**

---

### MNIST: Is Db-VAE Useful?

**Probably not**, unless you're targeting a specific bias problem in MNIST.

#### Why?

* MNIST digits are already centered, grayscale, and fairly uniform.
* Variability (like different handwriting styles) is part of the *task*, not a bias to eliminate.
* Db-VAE is meant to suppress information **not useful for classification** but **dominant in the data** due to bias (e.g., background, lighting, identity).

So unless you’re dealing with:

* **An unbalanced MNIST subset** (e.g., far more "1"s than "8"s)
* **Noise from an external factor** (e.g., digits written by only one demographic)

…it’s overkill.

### Better Options for MNIST Generalization:

If you want to handle **more handwriting variation**, consider:

| Technique                | Purpose                                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data augmentation**    | Simulate different styles (rotate, scale, distort digits) |
| **Dropout**              | Improve generalization                                    |
| **BatchNorm**            | Normalize internal representations                        |
| **Adversarial training** | Boost robustness to difficult inputs                      |
| **Capsule Networks**     | Capture pose and shape better than CNNs                   |

---

### Summary

* **Db-VAE is not well-suited** to improve performance on general handwriting variation unless there’s a **specific, known bias** in your MNIST data.
* You're better off using **data augmentation** or **standard regularization techniques** to make your digit detector more robust.
