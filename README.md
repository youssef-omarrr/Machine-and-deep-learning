# Machine Learning Study Roadmap
> Due to `Git lfs` problems, all 67 commits that included the whole repo's history have been deleted :(

##  Overview
This roadmap will include resources, projects, and notes that I will be following to develop a strong understanding of machine learning.

## Contents
- Prerequisites: a quick revision on numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.
- MIT 6.S191: Introduction to Deep Learning.
- Pytorch course.
- Projects: contains most projects, bigger projects have their own repos linked below.
- LLM from scratch course.
- [FUTURE] Reinforced learning projects.
