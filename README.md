# Machine Learning Study Roadmap
> Due to `Git LFS` problems, all 67 commits that included the repo's history had to be deleted :(

## Overview
This roadmap includes resources, projects, and notes that I am following to build a strong foundation in machine and deep learning.

## Contents
- **Prerequisites:** Quick revision on `NumPy`, `Pandas`, and `Matplotlib`.  
- **MIT 6.S191:** Introduction to Deep Learning.  
- **PyTorch Course**  
- **Projects:** Contains most course projects; larger projects have their own repos linked below.  
- **LLM from Scratch Course**  
- **ITI Summer Training:** Machine Learning (supervised and unsupervised).  
- **Graduation Project Notes:** Research notes from my Bachelor’s degree project on Parkinson’s disease (not the actual project, but concepts explored and ML-related notes for future reference).

## Projects & Practice
> - **Older projects** in this repo are mostly drafts and unpolished experiments.  
> - **More recent projects** were developed in their own dedicated repositories (including experiments and failed attempts), with only the key files mirrored here for a quick overview.  
> - For complete projects, please check the linked repositories.  

### **Main Projects**
- [**Project Mozart:**](https://github.com/youssef-omarrr/Project-Mozart) Custom Transformer-based music generation.  
- [**Brain Tumor Segmentation:**](https://github.com/youssef-omarrr/Brain-Tumor-Segmentation) Deep learning model for semantic segmentation of brain tumors from MRI scans.  
- [**German Tutor:**](https://github.com/youssef-omarrr/German-Tutor) AI-powered German language learning assistant.  
- [**CelluScan:**](https://github.com/youssef-omarrr/CelluScan) Automated blood cell classification with Vision Transformer.  
- [**Real-Time Number Detector Web App:**](https://github.com/youssef-omarrr/MNIST_Web_APP) Trained on MNIST + custom data.  

### **PyTorch Course Tasks**
- Fashion MNIST Model (with confusion matrix, Chapter 3)  
- Multi-class Evaluation Model (Non-linear, Chapter 2)  
- Linear Regression Model (Chapter 1)  
- **Final Project:**
