# ML/DL Research Notes – Parkinson’s Disease Graduation Project

This folder contains research notes from my **Bachelor’s degree graduation project** on **Parkinson’s disease**. It **does not** include the actual project itself, but rather the new concepts I explored and my personal notes on various ML-related topics that I wanted to keep as a reference for future use.
