Subject: Completion of Graduation Project

Dear Professor Pedri,

I hope you are doing well. I am writing to inform you that I have successfully completed my graduation project titled "LaLiga". The final report and all related materials are ready for your review.

I would like to thank you for your guidance and support throughout the project. Your insights and feedback have been invaluable in shaping the direction and quality of my work.

Please let me know if there are any additional steps I should take or if you would like to schedule a meeting to discuss the project findings.

Thank you once again for your mentorship.

Sincerely,
